I ran into 2 interesting situations while working on claimed/unclaimed surfaces that appeared different, but both were solved by referring back to some base principles, specifically the 4 rules of simple design.

First: what should the URL for unclaimed surfaces be? My first thought was /surfaces; That seemed reasonable. Then I wondered about using /surfaces/unclaimed. Is the extra part of the URL unnecessary, is it a violation of YAGNI?

Second: what should the URL for viewing your claimed surfaces be? Should it be /surfaces/claimed, showing the surfaces belonging to the logged-in user? Or, should I be explicit and use /users/:id/surfaces? Should I also add /users/:id/surfaces/claimed?

The 4 rules of simple design are as follows:

Passes all tests
Contains no duplication
Reveals Intent
Is Small

On an aside, J.B. Rainsberger makes a convincing argument that there are really only 2 rules: no duplication and reveals intent. He talks about it in this video interview.

Unclaimed Surfaces

A major thought in the user experience for the stickies project is the ability to very quickly try the system, even before registering. The surfaces created by unregistered users are considered 'unclaimed' and public to everyone else. I wrote a blog post outlining this approach a little while ago. One of the major decisions is what the URL should be for these surfaces. The natural first thought would be /surfaces, since it seems like a natural root name.

Thinking about this, though, I realised that the decision to use /surfaces as the url broke the rule about revealing intent. This rule can also be thought of as 'named clearly.' What is the expectation of /surfaces? In general, it is used as the index, or the list of all surfaces. Giving it an implicit filter (unclaimed) is a violation of this. Another interpretation of 'reveals intent' is the Principle of Least Surprise - you shouldn't be surprised when you access something. The most obvious solution is /surfaces/unclaimed.

Being explicit also opens you up to extensibility and future enhancements without having to worry about it. No, I'm not saying that you should be designing for unknown future requirements, but, given a choice, I like to choose the path which will give me the most flexibility in the future. Having explicit filters on the /surfaces URL provides both a precedent and a mechanism for this. One of the fundamental SOLID principles is the Open-Closed: system should be open for extensibility, closed for modification. There are a lot of resources about this, but it boils down to this: build systems that can accept behavorial changes through extension, not through modification of the core system. Taking this idea to our resource locators, as well. So, if we hide some implementation behind /surfaces, then we create the potential need to change what it means in the future. By relying on a form of extension, /surfaces/unclaimed, then we create a situation where we can more easily and predictable add future behaviors simply by adding a new filter: /surfaces/private or /surfaces/about_to_be_deleted, for example.


Claimed Surfaces

When using an authentication system in Rails, you generally are given a #current_user method on your controller. This allows you access to at least the id of the logged-in user. Unfortunately, I often will see people taking a shortcut when accessing resources, thereby creating a severe inconsistency in their addressing scheme. In our case, it would be using #current_user to scope the surfaces given when accessing /surfaces. This seems reasonable, since it feels like overkill to provide the user id on the URL: /users/:id/surfaces. We already have the user id, don't we? Don't the 4 rules say we shouldn't have duplication? Yes, they do, but this isn't really duplication.

The idea of duplication isn't just about code, but more importantly about concepts. The DRY principle (don't repeat yourself) is a form of 'every concept should have a single representation in your system.' There is a nice corollary that every representation should be of one concept.

Suppose you use /users/:id/surfaces to view some claimed surfaces (other people's), yet /surfaces or /surfaces/claimed to see your own. The concept of 'surfaces claimed by a user' now has two different representations in the system. The second rule of simple design (eliminate duplication) comes into play, so we should eliminate one of them; since we have a concrete use for /users/:id/surfaces, it makes sense to stick with that.

What about duplication between the user ids: if my id is 3, then I have /users/3/surfaces, and I also have a 3 in my session somewhere, stored as 'current user id.' Is this duplication? I say it isn't, since they represent two different concepts: the user who has claimed those surfaces and the user who is logged in. It is just happenstance when they coincide. When eliminating duplication, it is important to remember that you sometimes have constants which represent different concepts.

Aside: This idea of a number representing two different concepts comes up a lot at coderetreat. According to the rules of Conway's Game of Life, a live cell stays alive if it has 3 neighbors, and a dead cell comes to life if it has 3 neighbors. It is common to see people refactor both of those 3's into a single representation. This generally leads to less understandable code, as the meaning gets lost, muddled in a haze between two different thoughts. It also makes the system less flexible, as the extraction of the 'magic number'-ness of it becomes difficult, due to an unnecessary coupling between the two different rules.

Should it be /users/:id/surfaces/claimed?

This is an interesting question. One one hand, we do have /surfaces/unclaimed, so it seems as though the symmetry of having /users/:id/surfaces/claimed is desirable. But, taking this URL apart, we can notice something important: there is duplication in concept. The URL /users/:id/surfaces reads as 'the surfaces belonging to the user represented by :id.' The /surfaces/claimed reads 'the surfaces claimed by ...' Since 'belonging to' and 'claimed by' are synonyms in our system, we can see that the single URL /users/:id/surfaces/claimed has duplication in it. Since we have already seen that the prefix /users/:id is needed, the /claimed suffix should be dropped.

So, all of this discussion has lead us to the following identifiers for our collections:

/surfaces - all surfaces, both claimed and unclaimed. What does this mean, how best to represent it? I'm not sure, and I don't think we'll implement this quite yet;
/surfaces/unclaimed - all unclaimed surfaces;
/users/:id/surfaces - all claimed surfaces for user represented by :id;
