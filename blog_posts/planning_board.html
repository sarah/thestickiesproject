<p>So, Sarah and I have sticky notes being added, moved, editing, persisted, etc., and the application is coming along nicely. In fact, we are getting close to opening up the first public beta. Just having stickies is only good for a single decision, so the two remaining features are surfaces and users. The process we are modeling, as Sarah outlines in the original screencast, is a large surface with stickies moving around. So, using that metaphor, we are adding the concept of 'surfaces,' separate areas that you can add and manipulate stickies on. We already have a single-surface implementation done, so it is just a matter of having them associated with a specific surface.</p>

<p>We started discussing implementation details, and I brought up a technique that I learned from <a href="http://www.joefiorini.com/">Joe Fiorini</a> a while ago about resource modeling via URI. The basic idea (it can get more complex) is to focus on the URIs and the behaviors related to specific HTTP verbs. I mentioned this to Sarah, so we got out the whiteboard markers and her well-used eraser, and we began mapping both how users would interact with the system and how the application would interact with the backend resources. I didn't do it exactly as I learned from Joe, but the slightly looser form I used achieved our goals.</p>

<p>Here's a view of our final board, and I'll make some comments on it:</p>

<p>Side Note: Yes, that is a big-ass, framed whiteboard on Sarah's living room wall. Tell me that does not equal AWESOME!</p>

<p>One of the first things we talked about was</p>

<code>GET /surfaces/:name(.format)</code>

<p>as the canonical accessor for a surface and its stickies. When accessed via html, it would display the surface layout + the necessary javascript calls to place the stickies on the surface. One interesting feature that I really pushed for, inspired by http://tomatoi.st (the pomodor timer that we use while coding), is the idea that doing</p>

<code>GET on /surfaces/:non-existing-surface-name</code>

<p>would create that surface for you. I like the idea of just being able to create a new one as simply as possible. Sarah was worried about having too many of them just floating around, so we decided on having a cleanup job that would remove any surface that had not seen activity for an hour. I do worry about the possibility of a DOS attack, but, if we get to that point, then we can look at throttling techniques, maybe IP-based, as a simple workaround. I'd hate to think someone would do that to us, though. :) This also means that sharing a surface would be as simple as sending the URL.</p>

<p>I'll write more later about some of the other design decisions we made from this, but I wanted to get this up, especially to talk about the first interesting feature we are planning.</p>
